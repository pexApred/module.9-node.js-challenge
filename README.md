  ## Description

  A command-line application created to generate a high quality README file dynamically. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project itself. By answering a set of questions through prompts in the command-line, a README file will generate with the user's input data in the correct sections. This challenge provided practice using node.js, the use of packages such as inquirer, and writing functions to writeFile and return data.

Inquirer will be used for prompting the user with questions. Begin with npm init to set the environment. In order to install inquirer, use npm i inquirer@8.2.4. Once all is installed and functional, in your terminal, type node index.js to begin.

  Once your environment is running, type node index.js into terminal to recieve a series of prompts. Answer the prompts to the best of your abilities to ensure a high-quality README is generated at the end.
